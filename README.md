# Hangman

# Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Project Status
This project is still in development. **08/11/2023**

### Progress
