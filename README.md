# Hangman

# Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Project Aim
This is just a fun project for leisure to play a popular game and understand the logic behind it.
During the project I was able to practice implementing different aspects of software development in Pyhton. Mainly OOP.

# Installation/Usage
Clone the repo by entering the following in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dzidulak/hangman.git
```
Enter the hangman folder in the repo and run:
```
python milestone_5.py
```
The game can then be played in the terminal.

### Playing the game

After running the the game the following will show up in the terminal:

The word's missing letters are shown to the user and by following the instructions they can easily play the game in the terminal.
